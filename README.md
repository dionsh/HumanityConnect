HumanityConnect is a Good Deeds Tracker that Connects volunteers with events and tracks their hours or achievements. A Full-Stack Website that I made in the Digital School Champion Trials 48H Hackathon, where my platform was selected as one of the top projects from OVER 600 Applicants. Made with: HTML, CSS, JS, PHP &amp; MySQL, Bootstrap, Chart.js.
